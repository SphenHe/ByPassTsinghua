# Honor Code

## References from the internet

- I was strugling with the data_resize when chatgpt told me that I can use `scipy.ndimage.zoom` to resize the data.
- I was confused about label and chatgpt give me a way to use `set_xticks` and `set_xticklabels` to set the label.

## Communication with classmates

- Thanks to Wen Xinyang, who helped me figure out how to mix 4 pic together.
- Thanks to Si Shuyi, who reminded me that maybe I was using the wrong data range when I resize the data and got nothing at all.
