## References from the internet

- I was trying to find out if there was a "collection" object when chatgpt told me it existed, and then I checked the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) to find out how to use it.
- I was trying to find out if there was a "sort" function when chatgpt told me it existed, and then I checked the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3.11/howto/sorting.html#sorting-how-to) to find out how to use it.

## Communication with classmates

- I discussed with Yang Zhehan whether path compression could be counted as faster, Yang Zhehan thought that the number of queries was smaller so it wouldn't be faster, but I think it could make queries faster (even if it's just a small improvement)
