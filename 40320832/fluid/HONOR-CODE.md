- Thanks to Wen Xinyang, who helped me figure out that I forgot to call read_field when I perform bilinear
- Tnanks to Zhang Junyao, who helped me figure out lots of parameters errors in my code
- Thanks to Yang Zhehan, who helped me figure out that I commented a line of code that should not be commented

And, thanks to myself, who write such ugly code but stick to finishing the debug, and finally I made it (with the help of my classmates)
