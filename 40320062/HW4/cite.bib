  abstract = {Nuclear power plants, namely water-cooled nuclear reactors, constitute complex systems operated at conditions which put continuous challenges to materials, structures, and components. This is specifically true in the case of postulated accidents. The knowledge of the evolution of postulated accidents is mandatory to determine the challenges. The reactor design basis environment is considered ending-up in the so-called design basis accident. Postulated accidents or transient scenarios are decomposed by thermal-hydraulic phenomena. Following three decades work in the area, about more than 100 phenomena are found as reasonable to characterize expected transient scenarios in water-cooled reactors. Identification and (mostly qualitative) characterization of phenomena constitute the topic of the chapter. Phenomena are expected to be part of the modeling capabilities of computational tools.},

  abstract = {Natural circulation loops are thermohydraulic circuits used to transport heat from a source to a sink in the absence of a pump, using the forces induced by the thermal expansion of a working fluid to circulate it. Natural circulation loops have a wide range of engineering applications such as in nuclear power plants, solar systems, and geothermic and electronic cooling. The Lattice Boltzmann Method was applied to the simulation of this thermohydraulic system. This numerical method has several interesting features for engineering applications, such as parallelization capabilities or direct temporal convergence. A 2D model of a single-phase natural circulation mini-loop with a small inner diameter was implemented and tested under different operation conditions following a double distribution function approach (coupling a lattice for the fluid and a secondary lattice for the thermal field). An analytical relationship between the Reynolds number and the modified Grashof number was used to validate the numerical model. Two regimes were found for the circulation, a laminar regime for low Reynolds numbers and a non-laminar regime characterized by a traveling vortex near the heater and cooler's walls. Both regimes did not present flux inversion and are considered stable. The recirculation of the fluid can explain some of the heat transfer characteristics in each regime. Changing the Prandtl number to a higher value affects the transient response, increasing the temperature and velocity oscillations before reaching the steady state.},

  abstract = {Envisaged Nuclear Power Plant transient performances are translated via experiments and expert judgement into lists of accidents. Accident scenarios are at the origin of phenomena. Phenomena are characterized by parameters or variables. The parameter values can be translated into requirements for predictive capabilities in thermal-hydraulics. The safety acceptance criteria consist of threshold parameter values. These are established by logical processes typically independent upon thermal-hydraulics knowledge. A global vision of nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics is provided in the chapter from the side of phenomena and accident scenarios: 12 reactor types are considered for the characterization of 47 accident scenarios cross-linked with 113 phenomena and 15 sets of ``homogeneous'' variable time trends.},

Namely, selected cross-cutting issues from the thermal hydraulics universe are defined. This view is essential for understanding the content of the book and for self-confirming the level of understanding of thermal hydraulics by the reader. Two phase flows and heat transfer are concerned together with safety concepts. Examples moving from bases to applications are the fundamental relationship of thermal hydraulics involving quality, void fraction, slip ratio and pressure, the steam binding phenomenon, the design basis accident, the defense in depth, and the final safety analysis report.},
